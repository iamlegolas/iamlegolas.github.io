						<br/>I've honestly never been a fan of motion capture. I feel it's the complete opposite of what Disney's 12 Principles teach us, I feel it reduces the animator's role to making minor adjustments and clean up. For the animator, it takes away the thrill of putting oneself in the character's shoes, being the actor. Despite all that, it's almost exclusively what AAA game studios are resorting to and to be quite honest, it looks pretty darn good. I spent time thinking about why that might be. So usually, motion capture animation lack weight. For weight (and hence "life") in your animation, you need anticipation, squash, stretch, well thought-out timing and exaggerated poses, all of which require a fair amount of planning and skill to execute. I think motion capture in games works because pressing the buttons to make in-game characters do things IS the anticipation. You know what's coming when you press a button. This is of course augmented by the artists going in and fixing the motion capture at the end too. Rotoscoping and motion capture 3d, I think still lie on the fence between "The Uncanny Valley" and "Acceptable Animation" and I think the absence of anticipation created through button pressing is a major cause.

<!--						<br/>I'm fascinated with how muscles in the human body bring about deformations, expressions. I'm also trying to break into the entertainment industry as a Chracter Technical Director. -->
						<br/>I'm interested in knowing more about muscle system simulations causing deformations in skin meshes. I want to know if they can actually be incorporated into 3d art pipelines to aid productions, eliminate the tedious process of manually sculpting several blendshapes for character meshes. The bit about autonomous responsive characters also caught my eye because anything that makes processes better, faster or cheaper will eventually become standard. A big portion of the budget for big productions goes to asset creation. The process is just too time-consuming mostly because workflows being followed for these tasks are static which means you're getting just one output for going through the entire pipeline. A shift to more procedural workflows is inevitable and building transferrable skills enabing me to push for that future is what I'm aiming to do. As somebody trying to break in to the animation industry as a Character Technical Director, I was excited to be introduced to what Computer Graphics research in the field of Character Rigging and Simulation is like.
