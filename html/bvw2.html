						'Wacky Safari' is a seated VR experience built for the HTC Vive. For this Round of BVW, we were prompted to design and build a virtual world, the traversal of which required no instructions whatsover even for the most naive of guests. The world was also required to deliver a strong feeling of freedom to the guest.
						
						<br/><br/><b>What is BVW:</b> BVW (or Building Virtual Worlds), is the premier course for first years at CMU's Entertainment Technology Center. It is composed of 5 rounds spread throughout 1 semester. For each round, you're put in a random team of 5 (composed of 2 programmers, 2 artists, 1 sound designer) and the team is tasked with creating a complete AR/VR experience in the span of two weeks. After the 2 weeks, teams are shuffled.
						<br/><br/><br/>

						</div>
						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: A walkthrough of the entire experience.</span>
							
						<br/>The experience has the guest seated in a futuristic vehicle that transports him through a safari park. The only thing handed to the guest is a camera and he can take pictures of the many wacky animals he sees on his trip. The animals react to their pictures being taken in funny and unsual ways.
						
						<br /><br /><b>Game Design:</b> We decided on a seated experience very early on in the team discussions and the dire need to make use of virtual interactions that translated almost exactly to the physical world; our goal was always to cater to guests with absolutely 0 familiarty with AR/VR. For this very reason, we were firm on wanting to eliminate (direct) use of the Vive controller.
						<br/>Once we had set ground rules and decided on elements we wanted our world to have, we talked about theming and settled on the safari park idea. It allowed us to limit interactions to taking pictures using a camera prop. We made sure the size and layout of the prop translated exactly from the physical world to the virtual. We also, quite fairly, assumed that almost all guests will be familiar with how a normal camera is operated. This was strongly reimposed during our playtests.
						
						<br/><br/><br/>*Add images of camera prop and camera model* 
						
						<br/>Throughout playtests, guests felt confident using the camera and this reinforced in them a strong feeling of freedom as they took pictures at will of whatever they wanted. For our final presentation, we were to take a naive guest through our experience. After, the guest very enthusiastically rated our world a 10/10 for freedom. 
						
						<br/><br/><br/>*Add Twitch stream link if timestamps are a thing?*

						<br/>As practice (and also an expression of my love for Alex Turner), I took a break from Lebowski and tested my newly acquired knowledge of character design and solid constructional drawing by commiting to complete a 360 turnaround for a character design of Alex. I was satisfied with the result.

						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: 360 turnaround of Alex Turner's face. The end goal was to achieve a certain level of likeness in the design while restricting myself to the use of basic shapes. This allows for the design to be easily animated.</span>
						
						<br/>The daily exercises were paying off; I could sense improvement. I'd quite consistently spend time on the project and sometime in the February of 2018, a design just clicked. I finalized and executed it immediately.

						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: Final rough and inked 360 turnarounds of The Dude.</span>
						
						<br/>The design was complete. It was getting a lot of positive feedback from my mentors and the general public. I proceeded to the animation at this stage. I also started rereading Richard Williams' 'The Animator's Survival Kit' to brush up on the 12 Principles of Animation.

						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: 2nd iteration of the animation with the new character design. I knew the accents needed more "OOMPH". They weren't making use of the entire body.</span>
						
						<br/>Feedback suggested the key's were somewhat alright but the movement in the inbetweens lacked curves. It was too stiff. The entire animation was also missing anticipation and follow-through on the keys. Another suggestion was to have more easing-in and out for the starting, ending and transitions between actions. 
						<br/>The criticism was spot on and reinforced the need to study Williams' 'The Animator's Survival Kit' even more. I decided to start from scratch.

						</div>
						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: 3rd iteration based the feedback I recieved: 3 keys with the first two inbetweened.</span>
						
						<br/>This is where the animation currently stands. I need keyframes for the entire sequence to get a more tangible sense of how the acting and accents are going to play out. Then I need to inbetween everything.
						
						
						<br/><br/><span class="takeaways-title"> Notable Experiences: </span> <br />
						<ul class="takeaways-list">
							<li>Built up a habit of consistently studying and practicing the fundamentals of art and animation.</li>
							<li>Constantly sought, recieved and iterated on feedback and constructive criticism.</li>
							<li>Improved immensely as an artist, designer and animator.</li>
