						'Space Bar' is an asymmetrical co-op bartending experience designed to entertain naive guests at the <a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/festival/">2018 ETC Festival</a>. The experience was selected as 1 of the 16 experiences to be showcased at the festival.
						
						<br/><br/><b>What is BVW:</b> BVW (or Building Virtual Worlds), is the premier course for first years at CMU's Entertainment Technology Center. It is composed of 5 rounds spread throughout 1 semester. For each round, you're put in a random team of 5 (composed of 2 programmers, 2 artists, 1 sound designer) and the team is tasked with creating a complete AR/VR experience in the span of two weeks. After the 2 weeks, teams are shuffled.

						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: A walkthrough of the entire experience.</span>
							
						<br /><b>Game Design:</b> We started out with having separate Vive Play Spaces for both guests. Each had access to a unique colored soda and garnish. They'd have to communicate to fulfill orders. With this version of the game, the division of labor seemed forceful and wasn't something the world absolutely demanded. Throwing garnishes all the way over to the other player's Play Space was also hectic and punished guests way too often.
						<br />We quickly switched to having both guests in a single Play Space and kept everything else as before. With this, the multiplayer nature of the experience felt unnecessary. 
						<br />For the next iteration, we defined more distinct roles for each guest; 1 was incharge of the sodas, the other for the garnishes. The soda guest had too easy a time filling the glasses. To solve this, we moved the soda guest to a higher virtual location making the soda-dispensing more challenging. For the interest curve and making the soda guest's life more challenging, we had the garnish dispensers catch fire and become useless based on how good the guests did. At this stage, it was just a lot of iteration for balance.
						
						<br/><br/><b>Art:</b> As artist, I came up with several character designs for crazy looking aliens with personality. Given the timeline though, we restricted ourselves to just one character in an effort to manage scope.

						<br /><br />Blob (pronounced Bob because the 'l' is silent) was the character I chose for the world. With Blob, I took the opportunity to implement a rig that supported squash and stretch. Blob's spine was driven by an IK spline which gave him realistic shoulder and hip movement. He was also given an FK spine for more minute control over different sections of his spine.
						<br/>Once the basic skeleton, controls and IK handles were set up, I proceeded to add the stretch and squash. Basically, I wanted the spine joints to scale alongside the curve of the IK spline. Used 'Node Editor' for the IK spline's curve, created a 'Spine Info' node to get the real-time height of the spline curve. Dividing this value by the curve's original length using a 'MultiplyDivide Node', I was able to deduce the percentage change in length of the curve. Then, I simply applied this change to the appropriate axis of the scale value for all of Blob's spine joints. For volume preservation, I inversely scaled the other two axis of the scale value for Blob's spine.

						*Add video for rig's squash and stretch functionality*
						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: A showcase of the rig's squash and stretch functionality.</span>
						
						<br/>I animated the character and exported a single FBX accompanied by a text file with frame-by-frame breakdowns of all the animations. My final task regarding Blob was to import him into Unity for the programmers. <b>This is where trouble arose.</b>

						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: Final rough and inked 360 turnarounds of The Dude.</span>
						
						<br/>The design was complete. It was getting a lot of positive feedback from my mentors and the general public. I proceeded to the animation at this stage. I also started rereading Richard Williams' 'The Animator's Survival Kit' to brush up on the 12 Principles of Animation.

						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: 2nd iteration of the animation with the new character design. I knew the accents needed more "OOMPH". They weren't making use of the entire body.</span>
						
						<br/>Feedback suggested the key's were somewhat alright but the movement in the inbetweens lacked curves. It was too stiff. The entire animation was also missing anticipation and follow-through on the keys. Another suggestion was to have more easing-in and out for the starting, ending and transitions between actions. 
						<br/>The criticism was spot on and reinforced the need to study Williams' 'The Animator's Survival Kit' even more. I decided to start from scratch.

						<span class="media-description m-dsc-center">Above: 3rd iteration based the feedback I recieved: 3 keys with the first two inbetweened.</span>
						
						<br/>This is where the animation currently stands. I need keyframes for the entire sequence to get a more tangible sense of how the acting and accents are going to play out. Then I need to inbetween everything.
						
						
						<br/><br/><span class="takeaways-title"> Notable Experiences: </span> <br />
						<ul class="takeaways-list">
							<li>Built up a habit of consistently studying and practicing the fundamentals of art and animation.</li>
							<li>Constantly sought, recieved and iterated on feedback and constructive criticism.</li>
							<li>Improved immensely as an artist, designer and animator.</li>
						</ul>
