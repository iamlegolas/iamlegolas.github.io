						Based on merit, I was selected to spend a summer at the <a class="content-link" href="https://kuar.ku.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Koç University Arçelik Research (KUAR) design lab</a> to work on a project aimed at developing a system that made use of Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR).<br />

					<span class="content-title">Motivation:</span><br />
					 The project aims to aid the cooking process with the use of a seamless SAR system. Personally, I've been fascinated by Augmented and Virtual Augmented Reality as future mediums for storytelling and this project was an opportunity for me to gain hands on experience with one of these technologies.<br /><br />

					<span class="content-title">Process:</span><br />
					As the sole engineer on the team, my role was to build software for the system. My contribution to the project was:<br/>
					<ul>
						<li>the calibration of a projector and depth sensing camera together to be able to project the system’s user interface onto a flat surface.</li>
						<li>the incorporation of real-time object (mainly utensils) detection and tracking into the system.</li>
					<ul><br />
						This is what the setup looked like:<br /><br /><br />

					The project required an immense amount of self study on my part as I had to search for and familiarize myself with machine learning concepts and tools. Initially, I worked on utensil detection with cascaded binary classifiers using Haar-like features, and implemented a simple unsupervised confidence-based learning mechanism to reduce the number of false positives. To effectively track these detected utensils and surrounding regions, I implemented a pyramidal frame-to-frame optical flow procedure, which was inspired by the classic Lucas-Kanade optical flow method. Moving forward with this approach, however, would have me train separate classifiers for each utensil that I wanted to detect so I changed course looking for other solutions. I elevated to using a model convolutional network (CNN) that had been trained on the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet contains over 15 million high-resolution images belonging to roughly 22,000 categories so it could already detect most utensils on my list. I collected my own datasets for the utensils that were not included in ImageNet.<br /><br /><br />

					As for the calibration and projection, I resorted to use Gene Kogan’s open-source library which automates the calibration process.<br /><br /><br />

					I laid down the foundation for this project’s software upon which KUAR continues to build.<br /><br />

					<span class="content-title">Outcomes:</span><br /> I displayed resourcefulness and was able to achieve my targets with assistance only from the internet and developed a strong sense of self efficacy. I was the only programmer working with a team of designers and, overtime, I was able to communicate technicalities to them in layman terms which I feel is an extremely important ability to have when working in interdisciplinary teams.<br /><br /><br />
